# Black Women in Tech: A Data Story  
**By Quinisha Cockheran**

## Executive Summary  
This project explores the historical and ongoing underrepresentation of Black women in the tech industry through real-world data and visual storytelling. Using structured datasets and public industry reports, this analysis identifies key trends in representation, opportunity, satisfaction, burnout, and venture capital funding. The project culminates in a dual-format presentation‚Äîone designed for visual impact (Adobe Express), and one built for exploratory analysis (Tableau)‚Äîaimed at raising awareness and calling for structural equity in the innovation economy.

## Purpose  
Despite public commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), Black women remain among the most underrepresented and overlooked groups in tech. This project was created to highlight the real data behind that reality, using visual storytelling and data-driven analysis to drive understanding, urgency, and future-focused solutions rooted in equity and truth.

## Tools Used  
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì data cleaning, exploration, and visualization  
- **Pandas** ‚Äì data manipulation and filtering  
- **Matplotlib** ‚Äì visual charts in branded style  
- **Adobe Express** ‚Äì final storytelling presentation  
- **Tableau Public** ‚Äì interactive exploratory dashboard  
- **GitHub** ‚Äì version control and publication

## Methodology  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Public datasets from Kaggle, including tech diversity disclosures (2014‚Äì2018), HR dashboards, and funding records  
   - Government and organizational disclosures (EEO-1, Tech Sector Demographics)  
   - Manually extracted statistics from credible reports (CIO.com, McKinsey, Crunchbase, AnitaB.org, Deloitte)

2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaned and formatted in Python using Pandas  
   - Manually created calculated fields such as burnout proxies and estimated % representation  
   - Aligned all datasets with unified demographic categories for consistency

3. **Analysis Approach**  
   - Representation trend analysis (by role, gender, and race)  
   - Intersectional funding comparison across founders  
   - Burnout analysis via satisfaction scores, risk proxies, and job-level breakdown  
   - Custom loop diagram highlighting systemic strain as both emotional and structural

4. **Visual Storytelling**  
   - Python visuals: consistent purple color scheme and accessible labels  
   - Tableau visuals: company-level trends, burnout breakdowns, and demographic disparities  
   - Adobe Express: presentation structured as  
     **Representation ‚Üí Burden ‚Üí Emotional Toll ‚Üí Systemic Insight ‚Üí Call to Action**

## Key Findings  
- Black women made up only **1.09%** of tech professionals in 2016 and just **0.43%** of executive tech roles.  
- In 2023, Black women received only **0.34%** of all venture capital funding.  
- Black women are underrepresented in leadership and innovation teams at every career level.  
- Burnout and emotional strain are not caused by lack of ability, but by systemic exclusion and insufficient structural support.  
- Gender inclusion does not guarantee racial inclusion‚Äîmany companies scoring high on gender metrics fail on racial diversity.  
- DEI rollback efforts pose additional mental and professional threats to already marginalized workers.

## Outcomes  
- A complete storytelling presentation designed in Adobe Express, highlighting personal and systemic insight  
- An interactive Tableau dashboard with company-level and industry-wide data exploration  
- A clean, well-documented Jupyter Notebook with purple-branded visuals for reproducibility  
- A GitHub-hosted data story serving as a portfolio centerpiece for advocacy and data storytelling
