This dashboard explores the key factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster using a cleaned version of the Kaggle dataset. Built in Power BI, it uses slicers and visual comparisons to uncover trends by:
-Passenger Class
-Gender
-Age Group (Child, Teen, Adult, etc.)
-Family Status (Alone vs. With Family)

Key Insights:
-First-class passengers had the highest survival rates.
-Women consistently out-survived men across all classes.
-Children had the best odds of survival, while seniors had the worst.
-Traveling with family improved survival odds in all classes.

This project demonstrates both my business intelligence storytelling skills and Power BI visualization capabilities.
