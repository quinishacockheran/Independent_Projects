# Black Women in Tech: A Data Story on Representation, Reality, & Resilience
**By Quinisha Cockheran**

## Executive Summary  
This project explores the historical and ongoing underrepresentation of Black women in the tech industry through real-world data and visual storytelling. Using structured datasets and public industry reports, this analysis identifies key trends in representation, opportunity, satisfaction, and venture capital funding. The project culminates in a visual presentation aimed at raising awareness and calling for structural equity in the innovation economy.

## Purpose  
Despite public commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), Black women remain among the most underrepresented groups in tech. This project was created to highlight the real data behind that truth, using visual storytelling and technical analysis to drive understanding, urgency, and future-focused solutions.

## Tools Used  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ data cleaning, exploration, and visualization  
- **Pandas** â€“ data manipulation and filtering  
- **Matplotlib** â€“ visual charts in branded style  
- **Adobe Express** â€“ final presentation design  
- **Power BI & Tableau** â€“ exploratory visuals (select datasets)  
- **GitHub** â€“ version control and publication

## Methodology  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Public datasets from Kaggle, including tech diversity disclosures (2014â€“2018) and HR dashboard data  
   - Manually extracted stats from verified sources (CIO, McKinsey, Crunchbase, AnitaB.org)

2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaned and formatted using Pandas  
   - Aggregated data by demographic, job level, and funding group  
   - Created custom datasets for burnout risk and VC funding disparities

3. **Analysis Approach**  
   - Representation trend analysis (2014â€“2018)  
   - Comparative funding analysis (Black founders vs. general population)  
   - Cross-sectional burnout and satisfaction risk (by gender, role, department)  
   - Visual design aligned with presentation narrative

4. **Visual Storytelling**  
   - Created clean, color-consistent visuals in Jupyter  
   - Exported graphics into Adobe Express for presentation  
   - Developed a final data story structured as:  
     **Problem â†’ Burden â†’ Exposure â†’ Emotional Toll â†’ Call to Action**

## Key Findings  
- Black women made up only **1.09%** of tech professionals in 2018, and just **0.43%** of executive tech roles.  
- In 2023, Black women received only **0.34%** of all venture capital funding.  
- Multiple systemic gaps (pay, promotion, degree, mentorship) intersect to create emotional and career strain.  
- DEI rollbacks and lack of structural change continue to limit growth and retention.

## Outcomes  
- A complete, branded storytelling presentation built in Adobe Express  
- A clean notebook with reproducible, purple-themed visuals  
- A GitHub-hosted public data portfolio piece intended for recruiters, tech equity advocates, and community builders
